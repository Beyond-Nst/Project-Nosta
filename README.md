# Project-Nosta
here are codes that can help you with an OGFN project
please don't divulge too much
thank you for respecting and not sharing like any other project


the 12.41 dll only the other versions do not work and also the botsplayers 11.31 dll

the solo bots players dll version 11.31 can also malfunction it is under repair

the fiddler basic code 
works you have to change the url and some stuff if you wanted

or else to be easier but not compatible with all versions made with dll.cobalt or with a proxy server





there will also be a release of source codes to launch several Fortnite

don't hesitate to give a star if you are interested in having dlls for an OGFN project

this project and carried out by @Beyond
