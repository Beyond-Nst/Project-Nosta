# Project-Nosta
here are codes that can help you with an OGFN project
please don't divulge too much
some dlls were banned in 2019 by epic game
thank you for respecting and not sharing like any other project

DLL for Chapter 2 bots may not work only for version 12.41

the solo bots players dll version 11.31 can also malfunction it is under repair

the fiddler basic code 
works you have to change the url and some stuff if you wanted

or else to be easier but not compatible with all versions made with dll.cobalt or with a proxy server



this project and carried out by @Beyond

there will also be a release of source codes to launch several Fortnite

don't hesitate to give a star if you are interested in having dlls for an OGFN project
